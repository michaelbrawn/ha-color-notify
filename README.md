  Color Notify!

  RGB Light Notification Manager
</h1>
<h2 align="center">
This integration provides priority-based, colored event notifications for Home Assistant light entities.<br/>
It wraps an existing light and creates a new entity that supports colored and animated notifications.
</h2>

## Overview

**Color Notify** enables you to wrap an existing light entity and configure customizable, colorful notifications that display on the light. Notifications are prioritized and managed automatically, so only the highest-priority notification is shown. Standard light functions (on/off, brightness, color) are fully supported, even with notifications active.

## Features

- **Toggleable Notifications**: Notifications are represented as Switch entities. Simply turn on and off notifications an ColorNotifiy will sort out showing it on the appropriate lights.
- **Subscription-based Notifications**: Create notifications in "pools". Multiple pools can be created each containing multiple notiifcations, and wrapped lights can subscribe to each individual notification or entire pools at once.
- **Priority-based Notifications**: Assign a priority to each notification, so only the highest-priority active notification is shown. Lower-priority notifications can optionally temporarily display when activated.
- **Standard Light Control**: The wrapped light can continue to be used as a normal light, with on/off and color controls, just use the created wrapper light entity anywhere in place of the 'real' light entity.
- **Customizable Colors and Effects**: Configure colors, brightness levels, and animations for each notification. Animations can include loops and timed steps for complex sequences.

## Installation

### Manual Installation
1. Copy the integration files to `custom_components/ha-color-notify` in your Home Assistant configuration.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

### HACS Installation 
*(Color Notify is now a default HACS repo so step #1 should be unnecessary)*
1. Add `https://github.com/cobryan05/ha-color-notify` as a custom repository in HACS (select type "Integration")
2. Search for Color Notify in HACS and download it.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

### Adding the Integration
After installation, go to **Settings > Integrations**, click **Add Integration**, search for **Color Notify**, and follow the prompts to set up your first notification-enabled light entity.

---

## Configuration

When adding a ColorNotify integration you can select to create a new Light or a new Notification Pool. Once created each integration can be further customized by using the "Configure' button on the integration.

Notification Pools can be 'configured' to add/remove/modify notifications within that pool.

Lights can be 'configured' to update light options or subscribe a light to new notifications

### Setting up a New Light Entity

Set up a new light entity by adding a new Color Notify integration, or clicking "Add Hub" when on the Color Notifiy integration settings page.
When setting up a new Color Notify light entity, select an existing light to wrap. This will create a new entity with enhanced notification capabilities. Use this new entity in place of the original light for notification functionality. ***Color Notify will fight any changes you make to the 'real' bulb. Only interact with the new 'wrapper' entity!***

</p>

#### Light Options

- **Dynamic 'On' Priority**: When enabled, turning on the light directly will set it to a priority slightly above any active notifications, ensuring the light state overrides.
- **Auto-cycle Between Same-priority Notifications**: If multiple notifications have the same priority, they will cycle automatically. Use the delay setting to define how long each notification displays.
- **Temporary Display of Lower-priority Notifications**: When a new notification is activated, it can temporarily display regardless of its priority. Set the duration for this temporary display or disable it by setting it to 0.

---

### Configuring Notifications

Notifications can be customized with colors, priorities, and display patterns. Priorities control which notification is displayed if multiple are active.

</p>

#### Notification Options

- **Priority**: Determines the notification’s display priority.
- **Temporary Display on Activation**: Forces the notification to display briefly upon activation, even if it’s lower priority.
- **Automatic Clear After Timeout**: Automatically turns off the notification after a set timeout. The timeout timer starts as soon as the notification begins. A timeout of '0' will auto-clear immediately after the pattern finishes.
- **Color**: Sets a solid color for the notification.
- **Pattern**: Allows complex animations with sequences of colors and delays.
  - **Loop**: Use `[` to start and `], loopcnt` to end a loop (e.g., `], 5` for five repetitions).
  - **Step**: Each step is a JSON object with the following fields:

    | Field | Type | Required | Description |
    |-------|------|----------|-------------|
    | `rgb` | `[R,G,B]` | yes* | RGB color (0-255 per channel). Takes priority over `kelvin` if both are provided. |
    | `kelvin` | `int` | yes* | Color temperature in Kelvin (e.g., `2700` for warm white). Only used when `rgb` is not present. |
    | `delay` | `float` | no | Hold duration in seconds before advancing to the next step |
    | `transition` | `float` | no | Fade time in seconds. Uses Home Assistant's native `transition` parameter for smooth fading. |
    | `brightness` | `int` | no | Brightness (0-255). When set, brightness is sent explicitly to the light, preserving it across color changes. |

    *Each step must include `rgb` or `kelvin`. If both are provided, `rgb` is used and `kelvin` is ignored.

  - **Examples**:
    - Solid red for 0.5 seconds: `{"rgb": [255,0,0], "delay": 0.5}`
    - Fade to green over 0.5s, hold 1s, fade to warm white over 1s:
      ```
      {"rgb": [0,255,0], "transition": 0.5, "delay": 1}
      {"kelvin": 2700, "transition": 1}
      ```
    - Flash blue at fixed brightness:
      ```
      {"rgb": [0,0,255], "brightness": 128, "transition": 0.5, "delay": 0.5}
      {"kelvin": 2700, "brightness": 128, "transition": 1}
      ```

## Usage

Set up a new notification pool (a collection of notifications) by adding a new Color Notify integration, or clicking "Add Hub" when on the Color Notify integration settings page.

To add new notifications 'configure' a notification pool.

To change the notification a light is subscribed to 'configure' the light.

To activate a notification, simply switch on the desired notification’s switch entity.

## TODO

- ~~Separate RGB and brightness controls for animations.~~ Done -- use `"brightness"` in pattern steps.
- Add services for notification management (e.g., clear notifications, cycle notifications).
- ~~Fade control, non-RGB configs (hsv, color temp)~~ Done -- use `"transition"` for fades and `"kelvin"` for color temperature.

Enjoy using **Color Notify** for enhanced visual notifications in Home Assistant!
